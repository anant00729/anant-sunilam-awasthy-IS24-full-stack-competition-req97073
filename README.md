## ü™ü Overview

As part of the assessment process for the IS-24 Full Stack Developer Position, I developed a web application that manages and tracks other web applications created by the Province of BC. 

## ‚å®Ô∏è Getting started

**1. Cloning the repository (only once):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anant00729/anant-sunilam-awasthy-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073.git
```

**2. Installing NodeJS:**

1. Check to see if you have Node.js installed. On a Mac use the command `node-v` in terminal. If it is installed, the version in use will be reported in the terminal. If not, install it from [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

2. Check to see if you have npm installed. On a Mac use the command `npm -v`. If it is installed, the version will be reported. If you do not have it installed, run `npm install -g npm` in a terminal. 

**3. Configuring the project (only once):**

At the root folder of the project, run the following commands

```sh
npm i       # Installs the dependencies
npm i -D    # Installs development dependencies
npm start   # Runs the NodeJs server 
```

**4. Viewing the project:**

Launch a web browser and navigate to the specified URL.

```
http://localhost:5010/
```

**5. Viewing the Swagger Documentation:**

Launch a web browser and navigate to the Swagger Documentation.
